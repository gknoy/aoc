Daily puzzle inputs go in this folder.  
Running `scaffold.sh 2023 {day_number}` will create an `aoc_2023/input/{day_number}.txt` 
file when when scaffolding a new day's puzzle.
Just paste the contents of your daily puzzle input into that file, 
and the daily puzzle scripts will find it automatically.
